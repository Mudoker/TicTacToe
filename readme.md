# Background
This program contains mainly basic C++ syntax: list, strings, loop,... regardless of advanced techniques: dynamic programming, vectors,..., hence, it may not be fast or be able to handling complex errors.
# Weakness
- Only perform on a 3x3 - 2D surface.
- Code maybe redundant in some parts.
